// Server-Send Events - One Way Messaging

/*
	A server-send Event is when a web page automatically gets updates from a server.
	
	This was also possible berfore, but the web page would have to ask if any updates where available. With server-send Events, the updates come automatically.
	
	Example: Facebook/Twitter updates, stock price update, news feeds, sport results, etc.
